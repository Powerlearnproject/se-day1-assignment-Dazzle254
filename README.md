#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Sofware engineering is a methodical application of engineering concepts to software system design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. It entails developing dependable and effective software solutions utilizing organized techniques, programming languages, frameworks, and tools.
Importance in technology industry
It ensures high quality sotfware- Reduces software failures, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues.
Increases productivity and efficiency- Helps teams collaborate effectively using version control (Git), CI/CD pipelines, and automation tools.
Enables scalability and efficiency- ensures modular and scalable architecture, making software easier to update and expand.
It enables security and reliability- Implements security protocols to protect against cyber threats and data breaches.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1968 – Birth of Software Engineering (NATO Conference): software engineering was officially introduced at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference in Germany.It was a response to the Software Crisis, where software projects were failing due to lack of structured development methods.
1980s–1990s – Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):Programming shifted from procedural to object-oriented programming (OOP) with languages like C++, Java, and Python.This  significantly improved software scalability, leading to the development of complex applications like GUIs, enterprise software, and web applications.
2000s and present years – Agile, DevOps, and Cloud Computing:  Traditional Waterfall development gave way to Agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban) for faster, interactive software delivery.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning and analyzing requirements: it enables one to describe goals, risks and timelines.
Designing of a system: it enables one to define system software, create designs and select frameworks and tools.
Develop and implement the code: develop the code and do the testing to catch on early bugs.
Testing of the product: perform unit testing and fix bugs to improve performance.
Release of software for end users: implement and use the software in live environments.
Provide maintenance and support for clients:this is by providing support and trouble shooting.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology- used in government projects and construction.                                            	                
Approach	Linear, sequential process (one phase completes before the next starts).	
Project Structure	Well-defined phases: Planning → Design → Development → Testing →Deployment → Maintenance.
Flexibility	Rigid; changes are difficult and costly after the project starts.
Customer Involvement	Limited; customers provide requirements at the beginning and see the final product at the end.	
Agile Methodology-used in mobile applications and technology startups.
Interactive, flexible, and adaptive approach with continuous improvement.
Divides work into sprints or interactions, delivering functional software at each stage.
Highly flexible; changes can be incorporated at any stage.
Continuous involvement; feedback is given throughout the development process.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer
- Requirement analysis-process of comprehending and translating software requirements into code.
- Coding & Development: This process involves creating apps using programming languages like Python, Java, and C++.
- Debugging & Troubleshooting: Corrects mistakes and enhances functionality.
- Version Control — Uses tools like Git/GitHub to manage code changes.
- Cooperation: Works with product teams, testers, and designers.
Quality Assurance Engineer
- Test Design & Planning: Develops test cases, test scripts, and test plans.
- Bug Identification & Reporting: This process uses tools such as JIRA, TestRail, or Bugzilla to identify and record bugs.
- Performance testing: Verifies that the program functions properly in various scenarios.
- Security testing: finds weaknesses to stop online attacks.
- Manual and Automated Testing: Conducts user acceptance testing (UAT), system testing, integration testing, and unit testing.
Project manager
- Stakeholder communication: informs team members, clients, and executives.
- Resource Management: Effectively distributes staff, funds, and time.
- Agile/Scrum Implementation: Oversees sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives in Agile settings.
- Project Monitoring: Utilizes Asana, Trello, or JIRA to monitor progress.
- Quality & Compliance: Ensures that the finished product satisfies legal and business requirements.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
- Boosts Productivity:by offering features like code completion, syntax highlighting, and debugging tools, it cuts down on development time.
- Decreases Errors: Real-time error detection and correction are facilitated by integrated debugging.
- Makes Project Management Easier: Project structuring and dependency management are built into a lot of IDEs.
- Supports Multiple Languages: This feature enables developers to use a single tool to deal with multiple programming languages.
Examples:  Visual Studio Code (VS Code), pycharm, Eclipse
Importance of Version Control Systems (VCS)
- Tracks Code Changes: This enables developers to view previous literations of the code and roll back if necessary.
- Promotes Collaboration: It permits several developers to collaborate on a single project without erasing each other's modifications.
- Prevents Data Loss: All code versions are stored, lowering the possibility of unintentional loss.
Examples: Git, Github, Bitbicket

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenge: It gets harder to manage and comprehend big codebases as projects get bigger.
Solution: Utilize modular programming to divide code into more digestible chunks and adhere to best practices and coding standards for readability.
Challenge: Identifying and fixing bugs can be time-consuming and frustrating.
Solution: Use debugging tools (e.g., built-in debuggers in VS Code, PyCharm, or IntelliJ) and follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) to catch bugs early.
Challenge: New frameworks, languages, and tools emerge frequently, making it hard to stay updated.
Solution: Dedicate time to continuous learning through online courses (Coursera, Udemy) and follow tech blogs, documentation, and communities (Stack Overflow, GitHub, Reddit).
Challenge: Optimizing software for speed while keeping it secure is difficult.
Solution: Perform penetration testing to identify security vulnerabilities.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing are used to test functions of a software application and is performed by developers during the coding phase.
Importance: makes sure every module or function operates as intended and increases the modularity and maintainability of the code.
Integration testing tests how different modules or services work together and ensures that data flows correctly between components.e.g TestNG.
Importance: Identifies communication errors between software modules and ensures that dependent functions interact correctly.
System testing is used to test the entire system software and ensures features work correctly.
Importance: confirms that the program satisfies both functional and non-functional requirements and finds performance bottlenecks in practical settings.
Acceptance testing is conducted by end users or clients to verify that the software meets their requirements and ensures the system is ready for deployment.
Importance: Verifies that the program satisfies user expectations and business needs and lowers the possibility of launching a defective product.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of creating and refining prompts to enhance interactions with AI models, like ChatGPT.It  entails creating precise, well-organized, and contextually rich instructions to direct the AI to produce pertinent, accurate, and helpful answers.
Importance in interacting with AI models
-Improves Accuracy & Relevance: By giving precise instructions, well-written prompts cut down on ambiguous or inaccurate responses.
-Increases AI Efficiency: This reduces needless back and forth and helps AI produce more accurate responses more rapidly.
-Tailors AI Outputs to Specific Needs – Users can personalize responses by defining tone, style, and format (e.g., summaries, lists, code snippets).
-Maximizes AI's Potential — AI models like ChatGPT can execute complicated activities such as content generation, coding help, and data analysis more successfully with well-structured suggestions.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Tell me about christmas.
Improved prompt: Explain the origin of Christmas and its importance in the festivities and its meaning in our daily lives.
It is more effective since it reduces vague and produces clear instructions. It also reduces the back and forth set up.
